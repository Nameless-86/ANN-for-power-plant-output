Repository: ANN-for-power-plant-output

Introduction:
This GitHub repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting the output of a power plant. The dataset used in this project consists of various features such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and exhaust vacuum, which are used to predict the net hourly electrical energy output of the power plant. The project uses Python and the Keras library for building and training the ANN.

Installation:
To use the code in this repository, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Nameless-86/ANN-for-power-plant-output.git
Dependencies: This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Keras. Install the dependencies using the following command:
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib keras
Dataset: The dataset used in this project is included in the repository as "power_plant.csv". You can also download the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/nitindatta/archive-power-plant-output).
Usage:
Once the repository is cloned and dependencies are installed, you can run the ann_power_plant.py script to train and test the ANN model. The script performs the following steps:

Data loading: Loads the power plant dataset using Pandas.
Data preprocessing: Performs data preprocessing steps such as feature scaling and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model training: Builds and trains the ANN model using Keras, with customizable hyperparameters such as the number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, and learning rate.
Model evaluation: Evaluates the trained model using mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R-squared) metrics on the test data.
Model prediction: Predicts the net hourly electrical energy output for new data samples using the trained ANN model.
